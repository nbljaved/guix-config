Your current profile and other stuff (like channels.scm) is in ~/.config/guix/

#+CAPTION: To update this repository by fetching the config files from appropriate locations
#+begin_src shell
make
#+end_src

#+CAPTION: Link this repo's channel.scm file to your actual one
#+begin_src shell

ln -sf ~/guix-config/channels.scm ~/.config/guix/channels.scm

#+end_src

* ./scripts
./scripts/ is a folder that contains, you guessed it, useful scripts :)

- To solve binaries breaking due to expectations of FHS:
  * =./scripts/uv-guix-shell.sh= runs =uv= in a container with linux's File System Heirarchy (FHS)
  * =./scripts/fix-foreign-binary.sh= fixes a binary that is failing due to Guix not abiding by the FHS

* Guix as your OS

#+CAPTION: To reconfigure the system with my custom packages
#+begin_src sh

# sudo guix system reconfigure -L ~/guix-config/nbl /etc/config.scm
sudo guix system reconfigure /etc/config.scm

* TODO Guix Home
https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Declaring-the-Home-Environment.html

#+CAPTION: To set it up
#+begin_src sh

# The guix home import command reads some of the “dot files” such as ~/.bashrc found in your home directory and copies them to the given directory, ~/guix-config/guix-home in this case; it also reads the contents of your profile, ~/.guix-profile, and, based on that, it populates ~/guix-config/guix-home/home-configuration.scm with a Home configuration that resembles your current configuration. 

guix home import ~/guix-config/guix-home

#+end_src

#+CAPTION: To reconfigure
#+begin_src sh
guix home reconfigure ~/guix-config/guix-home/home-configuration.scm
#+end_src

#+CAPTION: Once the configuration looks good, you can first test it in a throw-away “container”
#+begin_src sh

guix home container path-to-home-config.scm

#+end_src

* Nix
I use Nix for packages that aren't currently available in Guix, or those I might need at a moments notice.

** Install Nix in non-guix linux distro
https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.28/installation/index.html
https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.28/quick-start.html

** Install Nix in Guix system
#+CAPTION: Enable nix service in Guix
(see [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Miscellaneous-Services.html][Guix Miscellaneous Services]])
#+begin_src lisp :eval no
;; Add this service in services /etc/config.scm
(service nix-service-type)
#+end_src

After guix system reconfigure configure Nix for your user:

 * Add a Nix channel and update it. See [[https://nixos.org/nix/manual/][Nix Package Manager Guide]].
 * Create a symlink to your profile and activate Nix profile: 

 #+CAPTION: This is what the Guix manual says, but I just did the source step
 #+begin_src shell :eval no
 ln -s "/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/$USER/profile" ~/.nix-profile
 source /run/current-system/profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh
 #+end_src

** Nix Channel setup

#+CAPTION: https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_channels
#+begin_src shell
## Common nix-channel commands

# Listing current channels
nix-channel --list

# Adding a primary channel
nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/channel-name nixos
# For eg: nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-25.05 nixos

# Adding other channels
nix-channel --add https://some.channel/url my-alias

# Remove a channel
nix-channel --remove channel-alias

# Updating a channel
nix-channel --update channel-alias

# Updating all channels
nix-channel --update

# Note that updating channels won't cause a rebuild in itself; if you
# want to update channels and rebuild, you can use nixos-rebuild with
# the --upgrade flag to do both in one step.

# Also need to load the <attribnute-name> channel
nix-channel --add channel-url <attribute-name>
#+end_src

** nix-env cheatsheet

#+begin_src shell :results output
curl cheat.sh/nix-env
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
# nix-env
# Manipulate or query Nix user environments.
# More information: <https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#sec-nix-env>.

# List all installed packages:
nix-env -q

# Query installed packages:
nix-env -q search_term

# Query available packages:
nix-env -qa search_term

# Install package:
nix-env -iA nixos.pkg_name

# Install a package from a URL:
nix-env -i pkg_name --file example.com

# Uninstall package:
nix-env -e pkg_name

# Upgrade one package:
nix-env -u pkg_name

# Upgrade all packages:
nix-env -u
#+end_example

** nix-env quickstart

#+CAPTION: https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.18/quick-start
#+begin_src shell
# See what installable packages are currently available in the channel:
nix-env --query --available --attr-path

# Install a package from the channel
nix-env --install --attr nixos.hello

# Uninstall a package:
nix-env --uninstall hello

# Test packages without installing them
nix-shell --packages hello

# To keep up-to-date with the channel, do:
nix-channel --update nixos
nix-env --upgrade '*'

# The latter command will upgrade each installed package for which
# there is a “newer” version (as determined by comparing the version
# numbers).

# If you're unhappy with the result of a nix-env action (e.g., an
# upgraded package turned out not to work properly), you can go back:

nix-env --rollback

You should periodically run the Nix garbage collector to get rid of unused packages, since uninstalls or upgrades don't actually delete them:

 nix-collect-garbage --delete-old
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

* Miscellaneous
